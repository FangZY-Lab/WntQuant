\arguments{
\item{file_paths}{Working directory path.}

\item{expression_accession_vector}{A vector of all sub-dataset names to be used for Wnt pathway analysis.}

\item{group_HL}{A file required for each sub-dataset to distinguish between high (H) and low (L) Wnt signaling activity groups. File column 1: Accession, column 2: Group1, column 3: Group2, column 4: Group1_Status, column 5: Group2_Status.}

\item{gene_difference_method}{Method for identifying differentially expressed genes associated with Wnt pathway activity: "limma", "t_test", "wilcox_test".}

\item{alternative}{When using t.test/wilcox.test/limma, select "two.sided", "less", or "greater" to assess Wnt activity-associated expression changes.}

\item{p_combine_method}{Method for integrating p-values across multiple sub-datasets within the same Wnt-related study, options include "fisher", "z.transform", "logit", "ctt".}

\item{using_FC}{Under "two.sided" condition. TRUE: weight p-values with directionality based on log2FC. FALSE: weight p-values with directionality based on sign(log2FC). Default is "FALSE".}

\item{na_ratio}{Maximum percentage of missing expression values allowed per gene across samples (default 50\%). Genes with missing percentage exceeding na_ratio will be removed from Wnt pathway analysis.}

\item{statistics}{Method for computing Score2 through specific p-value integration approaches: "arithmetic_mean", "median", "geometric_mean".}

\item{purpose}{Select "cleaned" for precision refinement of Wnt-related gene sets, or select "validated" for evaluation of external Wnt pathway gene sets.}

\item{quantile_threshold}{Based on Score2 ranking. Under "two.sided" condition, genes above the (1-quantile_threshold)×100\% percentile are retained as Wnt-activated genes, while genes below the (1-quantile_threshold)×100\% percentile are retained as Wnt-inhibited genes. Under "greater" and "less" conditions, genes in the upper (1-quantile_threshold)×100\% percentile are retained.}

\item{activation_geneset}{Wnt pathway activation gene sets to be cleaned. (Place in the working directory)}

\item{inhibition_geneset}{Wnt pathway inhibition gene sets to be cleaned. (Place in the working directory)}

\item{geneSets_gmt}{Wnt-related gene sets to be validated. (GMT file format, read using the 'read.gmt' function from the 'clusterProfiler' package)}

\item{min.sz}{Minimum gene set size for fGSEA analysis of Wnt pathway gene sets (default = 1).}

\item{max.sz}{Maximum gene set size for fGSEA analysis of Wnt pathway gene sets (default = 10000).}
}
\description{
The identified Wnt-associated gene sets undergo a precision cleaning procedure based on the Score2 metric.
Score2 can also be computed for specific Wnt-related biological contexts to validate the accuracy of external Wnt pathway gene sets.
